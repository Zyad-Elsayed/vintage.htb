### **Vintage Machine Attack Script**
This script automates the attack process for the **Vintage** machine from **Hack The Box**. It leverages tools like `bloodyAD`, `Impacket`, and Kerberos to perform a series of Active Directory enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation steps. The script is designed to streamline the process, making it easier to execute complex attacks with minimal manual intervention.

---

### **Features**
- **Automated Steps**: Executes a sequence of attacks, including:
  - Retrieving managed passwords for Group Managed Service Accounts (GMSA).
  - Adding users to privileged groups.
  - Modifying user account controls (UAC) and service principal names (SPN).
  - Dumping secrets using `Impacket-secretsdump`.
- **Error Handling**: Stops execution if any step fails, ensuring reliability.
- **Colorized Output**: Provides clear, color-coded feedback for each step.
- **Kerberos Integration**: Handles ticket granting tickets (TGT) and service tickets seamlessly.

---

### **Tools Used**
- **[bloodyAD](https://github.com/CravateRouge/bloodyAD)**: A Python-based tool for Active Directory enumeration and exploitation.
- **[Impacket](https://github.com/fortra/impacket)**: A collection of Python classes for working with network protocols.
- **Kerberos**: Used for authentication and ticket management.
